## Welcome to ChatAway!
ChatAway is a Web-Application that serves as a communication tool.
In ChatAway you can find different rooms and will be able to communicate with other
users in the same room.

#### How to use the app
ChatAway is hosted on Heroku and therefore there is nothing further for you to do, 
other than enter this URL into the address bar:\
http://chattingallday.herokuapp.com/

#### API
For information about available API calls please visit:\
http://chattingallday.herokuapp.com/api

The React part (admin part) of the chat program is currently not available, you will need to run the application locally for that. The code for React is found in the 'client' directory.
